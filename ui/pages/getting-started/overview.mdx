# Overview

There are three methods for executing CodeInsights: via command line, by using a configuration file within an existing repository, or through NodeJS integration.

The ideal method depends on your specific requirements.

* To run CodeInsights for a designated repository, a custom configuration file in that repo is the optimal approach.
* For a quick exploration or CI, the command line interface (CLI) is the most efficient choice.
* For integration with your own code, utilizing the NodeJS library is the best solution.

## Usage in an existing repository

First, install the package:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @codeinsights/js
```

Then, create a configuration file called `codeinsights.config.ts` in the root of your repository. (`.js` and `.json` files are also supported)

Finally, run the following command:

```bash
@codeinsights/js
```

## Usage from command line

```bash
$ npx @codeinsights/js --repoPath "/path/to/repo"
```

## Usage from NodeJS

First, install the package:

```bash
$ npm install @codeinsights/js
```

Then, call the init function with the repository URL, or path:
```typescript
import { init } from "@codeinsights/js/src/api";

 const result = await init({
    repoPath: url
  })
}
```
